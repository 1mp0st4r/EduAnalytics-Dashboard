# üö© Risk Flags Implementation - Complete Tracking System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive risk flags tracking system that captures and manages all the detailed risk factors identified by the SHAP analysis in the Jupyter notebook.

## üîç **What Was Missing Before**

The Jupyter notebook generates detailed **SHAP-based risk analysis** with specific **red flags** and **green flags** for each student, but our previous implementation was not properly capturing and utilizing these detailed risk factors.

### **Specific Flags Being Generated by SHAP Analysis:**

#### **Red Flags (Risk Factors):**
- `IsFirstGenerationLearner` - First generation learner
- `MarksTrend` - Declining academic performance trend  
- `AvgAttendance LatestTerm` - Low attendance in latest term
- `WorksPartTime` - Student works part-time
- `MediumChanged` - Changed medium of instruction
- `IsMotherLiterate` - Mother's literacy status impact
- `FailureRate LatestTerm` - High failure rate in latest term
- `FamilyEconomicStatus General Tier` - Economic status impact

#### **Green Flags (Protective Factors):**
- `HasReliableInternet` - Access to reliable internet
- `IsPreparingCompetitiveExam` - Preparing for competitive exams
- `FamilyAnnualIncome` - Adequate family income support
- `IsMotherLiterate` - Mother's literacy as protective factor
- `IsFatherLiterate` - Father's literacy status
- `FatherEducation` - Father's education level
- `MotherEducation` - Mother's education level

## ‚úÖ **What We've Implemented**

### **1. Risk Flag Tracking System (`lib/risk-flag-tracker.ts`)**

A comprehensive system that:
- **Captures SHAP Analysis Results**: Processes red flags and green flags from ML analysis
- **Categorizes Risk Factors**: Academic, Socioeconomic, Family, Behavioral, Infrastructure
- **Tracks Impact Scores**: Quantifies the impact of each risk factor
- **Manages Flag Lifecycle**: Creation, updates, and status tracking
- **Provides Analytics**: Statistics and trends for risk factors

### **2. Enhanced Student Risk Analysis API (`app/api/students/[id]/risk-analysis/route.ts`)**

New endpoint that:
- **Integrates with ML Service**: Calls the SHAP analysis when available
- **Generates Comprehensive Risk Analysis**: Creates detailed risk profiles
- **Processes Risk Flags**: Converts SHAP results into structured flag data
- **Provides Fallback Analysis**: Uses rule-based analysis when ML service unavailable

### **3. Risk Flags Dashboard (`components/risk/risk-flags-dashboard.tsx`)**

A comprehensive dashboard that displays:
- **Risk Statistics**: Total students, flags by type, risk level distribution
- **Flag Management**: View, filter, and search all risk flags
- **Student Profiles**: Individual student risk profiles with flags
- **Analytics**: Trends and patterns in risk factors

### **4. Enhanced Student Analyzer (`components/ai/student-analyzer.tsx`)**

Updated to:
- **Integrate with Risk Flag System**: Uses the new risk analysis API
- **Generate Targeted Recommendations**: Based on specific risk flags
- **Provide Flag-based Interventions**: Tailored interventions for each risk factor
- **Display Comprehensive Analysis**: Shows both traditional and flag-based analysis

### **5. Risk Flags Statistics API (`app/api/risk-flags/stats/route.ts`)**

Provides:
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Risk level distribution, flag counts, top factors
- **Mock Data Generation**: For demonstration and testing
- **Real-time Updates**: Current risk flag status
