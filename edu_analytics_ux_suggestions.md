# UX and Functionality Suggestions for EduAnalytics (Student Dropout Tracker)

## High Priority
1. **Login / Onboarding** – Add clear error messages for login failures (e.g., “Wrong username/password”).  
2. **Sign Up Flow** – Smooth sign-up with required fields, password strength, role selection.  
3. **User Role Distinction** – Separate dashboards for admins vs. students with clear permissions.  
4. **Visual Hierarchy & Feedback** – Loading indicators, hover/focus styles, tooltips.  
5. **Responsiveness / Mobile** – Ensure all pages, especially dashboards, are mobile-friendly.

## Medium Priority
6. **Dashboard Clarity** – Show clear metrics: dropout rate, at‑risk students, trends, drill‑down.  
7. **Navigation & Structure** – Use sidebar or top nav bar (Dashboard, Students, Alerts, Reports, Settings).  
8. **Search / Filter / Sort** – For student lists, enable search, filters, and sorting.  
9. **Data Export / Reports** – Export CSV / PDF, allow scheduled reports.  
10. **Help / Documentation** – Inline tooltips, info icons, help page.

## Lower Priority / Nice to Have
11. **User Profile & Settings** – Change password, update profile, notification preferences.  
12. **Notifications & Alerts** – Admin alerts when risk threshold is crossed, student reminders.  
13. **Customization / Theming** – Admins adjust thresholds, dashboard widgets.  
14. **Performance / Loading** – Use caching, lazy loading, skeleton screens.  
15. **Security Features** – Strong password encryption, session timeouts, validation, CSRF protection.

## Specific UI / Copy Suggestions
- Hide dev-only links like “System Tests”, “Database Email” from end users.  
- Improve visibility and consistency of “Sign Up” link.  
- Replace two separate “Login as Admin / Student” buttons with a role selection toggle.  
- Add “Show/Hide Password” toggle.  
- Provide feedback when submitting forms (“Logging in…”).  
- Clarify if signup requires email confirmation.

---

## Flow & Accessibility
- Map typical journeys: **Student** (sign up → login → metrics/suggestions) vs. **Admin** (dashboard → students → reports).  
- Ensure accessibility: keyboard navigation, labels, color contrast, alt text.

---

## Advanced Features (Future)
- Predictive alerts for at-risk students.  
- What-if scenario analysis (impact of improved attendance).  
- Cohort comparisons across classes/batches.  
- Intervention logging to track outcomes.
